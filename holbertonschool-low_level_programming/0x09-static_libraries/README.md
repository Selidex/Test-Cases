There are no test cases needed for this project. Just remember to follow
the instructions as closely as possible, and for the blog assignment
remember to be thorough, give command line examples if applicable
and take your time. We have all weekend to complete these two projects
and both are pretty short compared to what we have been doing. Good luck
and if possible have fun!
