All test cases will be read into the file through command line

We are given that the numbers and their multiplication will be
able to be stored into int so no need to account for upper or
lower bounds (int does this for us)

Base Case:

./mul 7 9

./mul -2 12

./mul 13 0

./mul -2 -16


Incorrect number of commands passed

./mul 1

./mul 2 18 29



Non-number passed

./mul e 8
