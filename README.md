# Test-Cases
This repository is for collaboration of creation of test cases for Holberton Projects.

Only test cases should be provided. Any code pushed to the repository will be deleted,
and a second infraction will result in push privaleges being revoked. Please add any cases
you can think of even if you feel that it should be an obvious case, as it might not be 
obvious to other students. Feel free to add an explination on why a case might be special.
Some prime examples include INT_MIN, INT_MAX, empty strings, pointers to NULL, etc.
