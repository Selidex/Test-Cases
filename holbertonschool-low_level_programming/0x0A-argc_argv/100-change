All test cases will be read into a command line as the .c file is run.

Base Case:

./change 100



Not exactly one command is passed:

./change 100 2
./change


No number is passed, exactly one command is passed:

./change bob


Test to make sure you are extracting a number from the string using atoi:

./change bob52


Negative number is passed:

./change bob-100

./change -27



Cases to think about but not present yet:
Is there an upper limit to what they can pass you?
